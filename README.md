# Writing-Portfolio
A compilation of works to demonstrate technical writing ability.

With a passion for both STEM and creative writing, I thrive at the intersection of technical precision and rhetorical impact. Engineers often get fixated on the scientific side of report writing with a sort of myopic hyperfocus – deeply immersed in the data and specifications, yet blind to the broader communicative goals: proposing an idea, conveying progress to stakeholders, or translating complexity into actionable insight. Many engineers have attempted to combat this issue through the use of AI but, while almost sufficient, machines tend to miss the nuance of truly captivating writing, leaving the final product feeling hollow. At the end of the day, who is going to remain engaged in a piece of text that is soulless, dense with esoteric phrasing, and monotonous in tone? No one. 

 

I truly believe even technical work can – and should – be presented in a compelling and engaging way, and I further believe I have that unique ability. Not only through report writing aimed at fellow professionals, but through experience writing speeches for technical presentations or the production of fun public-facing infographics which seize and hold the attention of even the most unenthusiastic and non-technical audience. This ability isn’t just a superfluous boast, it’s vital to cross-functional collaboration, technical marketing, and feasibility proposal; these domains require an individual who is both well-versed in the technical detail and theory, in addition to the effective application of the English language. That’s me. 

 

I am confident you will be able to glean this proficiency through the documents contained within this repository, and I thank you for taking the time to peruse my little collection of works.  

 

All the best – Harry Lawson
